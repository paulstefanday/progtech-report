            We all know anecdotally that the progressive sectorâ€™s tech isnâ€™t
            working as well as we want it to - but what exactly are the problems
            and how widespread are they?

          <p>
            Organisations reported both a short term and a long term gap. Our
            tech isnâ€™t working for us, or the communities we work with, on a
            day-to-day basis. But weâ€™re also not doing the long-term planning
            and building we need to set our movements up for success in the
            future.

                . Key themes included:

              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A <strong>lack of budget</strong>, capacity and resource
                  prioritisation for tech, which is exacerbated for smaller
                  grassroots organisations by the high costs of many tools and
                  agencies
                </li>
                <li>
                  The <strong>lack of internal tech skills </strong>which is
                  further exacerbated by the
                  <strong> lack of training opportunities</strong> to upskill
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Dissatisfaction with current tech stacks </strong>due
                  to limited functionality and flexibility
                </li>
                <li>
                  The<strong> lack of integration</strong> between multiple
                  tools and platforms
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                <strong>
                  The smaller the organisation&rsquo;s budget, the more
                  frequently these problems were mentioned &ndash;&nbsp;
                </strong>
                particularly the lack of resources, capacity and skills to
                execute a good tech program, as well as dissatisfaction with
                their current tech stack, particularly their CRMs. This often
                caused a reliance on agencies that strained limited budgets, and
                were not suitable for the rapid response nature of
                advocacy.&nbsp;
              </p>
              <p>
                Some larger organisations mentioned a lack of data analytics
                tools, major issues with integrating multiple tools and a theme
                of resistance to change tech from senior management. Even though
                their organisations often had sufficient budgets, large NGOs and
                unions still consistently named the challenge of struggling to
                hire tech staff and lacking the inhouse tech skills for many
                projects.

            The good news is that between us we have the tools and skills to
            solve these problems collectively, and progressive organisations are
            ready to collaborate to make this happen.

            Survey participants said they would consider sharing their current
            technology, and contributing to developing new open tools for
            like-minded organisations. People named a wide variety of tech and
            digital skills they wanted to learn - most of which were skills that
            other participants said they were able to share. The majority of
            organisations want to collaborate but just havenâ€™t had the
            relationships or a space to do so.

                It is interesting to compare people&rsquo;s long-term and

                organisation&rsquo;s short-term priorities (Q2) and internal

              <p>
                Long-term priorities that were also mentioned as short-term

                  purpose for Australian organisations (rather than American),
                  for grassroots organising contexts, and for First Nations and

                Long-term movement-wide priorities that were barely mentioned in

                collaboration &ndash; are particularly important to highlight
                given there is a shared analysis of the need, but very few

              <p>
                We are a growing network of progressive member organisations
                committed to teaming up on tech to win. We want a world where
                progressive organisations and activists have the best tools
                possible, and the skills and support to use them.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our network of progressive campaigning organisations and the
                tech vendors &amp; agencies who support us widens access to
                existing tech tools and skills, and drives longer term,
                movement-scale planning around the tech we need to fight for and
                win progressive change.
              </p>
